# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**NOTE:** For CLI interfaces, we support SemVer approach. However, for API components we don't use SemVer as of now. This may lead to instability when using dbx API methods directly.
