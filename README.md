## Project Overview

`SDP-META` is a metadata-driven framework for [Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/spark-declarative-pipelines). Define your Bronze and Silver pipelines in a JSON or YAML onboarding file — a single generic Declarative Pipeline reads the resulting DataflowSpec at runtime and builds the full processing graph automatically. No pipeline code to write.

### Components

#### Metadata Interface

- **Onboarding file** (JSON or YAML) — sources, targets, CDC config, DQE rules. Examples: [`demo/conf/json/onboarding.template`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta/blob/main/demo/conf/json/onboarding.template) · [`demo/conf/yml/onboarding.template.yml`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta/blob/main/demo/conf/yml/onboarding.template.yml)
- **Data Quality Expectations** — per-table JSON or YAML rule files. Examples: [`demo/conf/json/dqe/customers/`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta/tree/main/demo/conf/json/dqe/customers) · [`demo/conf/yml/dqe/customers/`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta/tree/main/demo/conf/yml/dqe/customers)
- **Silver transformation file** — SQL `select_exp` and `where_clause` definitions. Examples: [`demo/conf/json/silver_transformations.json`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta/blob/main/demo/conf/json/silver_transformations.json) · [`demo/conf/yml/silver_transformations.yml`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta/blob/main/demo/conf/yml/silver_transformations.yml)

#### Generic Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline

- Reads DataflowSpec at runtime and dynamically wires sources, transformations, expectations, CDC flows, and sinks
- Supports Autoloader, Delta, Kafka, Eventhub, and Snapshot sources
- Applies [`create_auto_cdc_flow`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-apply-changes), [`append_flow`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-append-flow), and [`create_sink`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-sink) based on metadata

## Feature Matrix

### Pipeline Capabilities

| Feature | Layers |
|---|---|
| Input sources — Autoloader, Delta, Kafka, Eventhub, Snapshot | Bronze, Silver |
| Medallion architecture | Bronze → Silver |
| Bronze ↔ Silver pipeline chaining (`layer=bronze_silver`) | Both |
| Custom transformation functions | Bronze, Silver |
| Data Quality Expectations | Bronze, Silver |
| Quarantine table | Bronze, Silver |
| Liquid clustering | Bronze, Bronze Quarantine, Silver |
| [`create_auto_cdc_flow`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-apply-changes) — CDC via `bronze_cdc_apply_changes` | Bronze, Silver |
| Multi-source CDC (`bronze_cdc_apply_changes_flows` / `silver_cdc_apply_changes_flows`) | Bronze, Silver |
| [`create_auto_cdc_from_snapshot_flow`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-apply-changes-from-snapshot) — Snapshot CDC | Bronze |
| [`append_flow`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-append-flow) — via `bronze_append_flows` | Bronze |
| [`create_sink`](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ldp/developer/ldp-python-ref-sink) — Delta and Kafka sinks | Bronze, Silver |
| Row filters | Bronze, Silver |

### Deployment & Tooling

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| [Declarative Automation Bundles](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/) | Git-tracked pipelines, `dev`/`prod` targets, CI/CD-ready. Commands: `bundle-init`, `bundle-prepare-wheel`, `bundle-add-flow`, `bundle-validate`. See [`DAB_README.md`](DAB_README.md). |
| [SDP-META CLI](https://databrickslabs.github.io/sdp-meta/docs/getting-started/cli) | `databricks labs sdp-meta onboard` · `deploy` · `bundle-*` |
| [SDP-META App](https://databrickslabs.github.io/sdp-meta/docs/getting-started/app) | Browser-based UI for onboarding, deployment, and pipeline monitoring |
| [MCP Server](https://databrickslabs.github.io/sdp-meta/docs/getting-started/mcp) | AI-assisted pipeline scaffolding via MCP-capable AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and others) |

## Getting Started

SDP-META has three ways to use it — pick the one that matches your role and how far you intend to take it:

1. **[Declarative Automation Bundle](GETTING_STARTED.md#path-a--declarative-automation-bundle-recommended)** *(recommended)* — `dev`/`prod` targets, git-tracked state, CI/CD-ready. `bundle-init --quickstart` skips every prompt and gets you a working bundle in one command.
2. **[Interactive `onboard` + `deploy` CLI](GETTING_STARTED.md#path-b--interactive-onboard--deploy-cli-exploration-only)** — kick the tires against a single workspace.
3. **[SDP-META Databricks App](GETTING_STARTED.md#path-c--sdp-meta-databricks-app-browser-ui)** — browser-based UI for non-developers, demos, and click-driven workflows.

See **[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)** for prereqs, install commands, full per-path walkthroughs, local development setup, and troubleshooting. Long form: [docs site](https://databrickslabs.github.io/sdp-meta/docs/getting-started).

## Upgrading from DLT-META

The v0.1.0 release renames **DLT-META** to **SDP-META**. Existing onboarding JSON/YAML files and pipeline behavior are unchanged, but new code should move to the new package, CLI, and import path:

| Area | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| PyPI package | `dlt-meta` | `databricks-labs-sdp-meta` |
| Labs CLI | `databricks labs dlt-meta` | `databricks labs sdp-meta` |
| Python imports | `from dlt_meta import ...` | `from databricks.labs.sdp_meta import ...` |

The `dlt-meta` compatibility package remains available during v0.1.x, but it emits deprecation warnings and receives no new features. Legacy `src.*` imports are planned for removal in v0.2.0.

See the **[DLT-META → SDP-META migration guide](https://databrickslabs.github.io/sdp-meta/docs/operations/migration)** for the step-by-step plan, compatibility details, and deprecation timeline.
