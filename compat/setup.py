"""Setup file for the ``dlt-meta`` compatibility wrapper.

This distribution exists so ``pip install dlt-meta`` keeps resolving on
PyPI for v0.0.10 customers. It is a thin **redirect**: it depends on the
primary ``databricks-labs-sdp-meta`` package and ships none of the
compat code itself.

Why ship no packages
--------------------
The primary ``databricks-labs-sdp-meta`` wheel already bundles BOTH
compat surfaces at its purelib root (see the top-level ``setup.py``):

  * the ``dlt_meta`` flat re-export package (from ``compat/dlt_meta/``)
  * the ``src`` v0.0.10 re-export package (from ``compat/src/``)

If this wrapper ALSO shipped ``dlt_meta`` and ``src``, then
``pip install dlt-meta`` (which pulls in ``databricks-labs-sdp-meta`` as
a dependency) would install BOTH distributions, each writing the same
``site-packages/dlt_meta/`` and ``site-packages/src/`` files. The two
``RECORD`` manifests would both claim those files, so uninstalling
either distribution would delete files the other still needs. Shipping
them from exactly one distribution (the primary one) avoids the
collision entirely; this wrapper relies on the dependency to provide
them.

    """Ship ``dlt_meta.pth`` at the wheel's purelib root.

    The usual ``build_py``-based trick (copy the ``.pth`` into
    ``build_lib`` so it lands in the wheel root) does NOT work here:
    this distribution declares ``packages=[]`` (see the module
    docstring — the ``dlt_meta`` / ``src`` packages come from the
    ``databricks-labs-sdp-meta`` dependency, not this wheel), and with
    nothing to build modern setuptools skips ``build_py`` entirely, so
    the override never fires.

    Instead we hook ``bdist_wheel``, which always runs. ``write_wheelfile``
    is invoked once ``self.bdist_dir`` is fully populated and just before
    the archive is zipped from it, so dropping the ``.pth`` into
    ``bdist_dir`` there gets it into both the wheel and its ``RECORD``.
    The wheel stays pure-python (``Root-Is-Purelib: true``), so pip
    extracts the root straight into site-packages and ``site.py`` picks
    up the ``.pth`` at interpreter startup.

    Note: this is a **best-effort** auto-load convenience, not the load-
    bearing mechanism. The actual ``from src.* import …`` resolution on
    serverless DLT is carried by the real ``src`` package shipped in the
    ``databricks-labs-sdp-meta`` wheel — serverless ``%pip install`` does
    not re-trigger ``site.py``'s ``.pth`` scan, so the ``.pth`` only
    fires for a normal ``pip install`` followed by a fresh interpreter.
    The ``.pth`` does NOT collide with the primary wheel (which ships no
    ``.pth``), so it is safe to ship here.

# DLT-META Compatibility Package

**DEPRECATED**: This package is a compatibility wrapper for
[databricks-labs-sdp-meta](https://pypi.org/project/databricks-labs-sdp-meta/)
(DLT-META is now SDP-META). Installing it pulls in the new package and keeps
existing `dlt_meta` / `src.*` imports working unchanged.

## Migration

Replace:
```bash
pip install dlt-meta
```

With:
```bash
pip install databricks-labs-sdp-meta
```

And migrate imports when convenient:
```python
# old (still works via this wrapper)
from src.dataflow_pipeline import DataflowPipeline
# new
from databricks.labs.sdp_meta.dataflow_pipeline import DataflowPipeline
```

All functionality is identical. This wrapper is maintained for backwards
compatibility; new features land only in `databricks-labs-sdp-meta`.
