"""Curated registry of demo onboarding specs bundled with the App.

Surfaced via ``GET /onboarding/bundled-specs`` so the UI can render a
"pick a demo" dropdown instead of forcing the user to know the exact
relative path of each spec file.

Curation principle: **every entry in this registry must onboard
out-of-the-box** with the default form values (Environment=demo,
update_paths=Yes, local_directory=demo/). Specs that need external
infrastructure (Event Hubs, Kafka, custom UC source tables), multi-
step orchestration (Silver Fanout's two-pass onboarding), or
non-default ``{placeholder}`` substitutions are deliberately omitted
because users can't recover from those failures without leaving the
App. If a future demo needs one of those fixes, add it here as a
transparent override (see ``merge_with`` for the Cloud Files A2 row
merge, and ``env_override`` for the DAIS ``_prod`` suffix override).

Out-of-the-box requirements an entry must satisfy:

  * Every ``source_format`` row must have a ``source_details`` block.
  * Every ``{placeholder}`` in the template must be one of the four
    the App substitutes: ``{uc_volume_path}``, ``{uc_catalog_name}``,
    ``{bronze_schema}``, ``{silver_schema}``.
  * Any file referenced by ``source_path_*``, ``source_schema_path``,
    ``*_data_quality_expectations_json_*``, or
    ``silver_transformation_json_*`` must exist under ``demo/`` so it
    gets copied to the UC Volume when ``update_paths=Yes`` fires.
  * No reliance on tables created by other specs unless the entry
    declares them via ``merge_with`` (which causes the picker to
    transparently concatenate the dependent spec's rows into the same
    onboarding pass).
  * The template's env suffix (``_demo``, ``_prod``, ...) must match
    the Environment field's value at submit time, OR the entry must
    declare ``env_override`` to force the right value.

The current 4 entries (Cars, Multi-Source CDC, Cloud Files,
DAIS) all satisfy this contract. Keep this registry in lockstep
with ``databricks_app/routes/demo.py::_DEMO_REGISTRY``.

# Each entry maps a *base name* (no extension) to:
#
#   - label: short, scannable title for the dropdown.
#   - description: 1-line "what does this demo show me" hint.
#   - tags: searchable keywords surfaced in the UI as small pills.
#   - merge_with: optional list of OTHER base names whose rows should
#     be CONCATENATED into this entry's rendered spec at request time.
#     Used to paper over runtime dependencies on tables produced by
#     companion specs (e.g. Cloud Files A1's silver append-flow reads
#     ``customers_delta`` which the A2 spec produces). The picker
#     materialises a single merged file so the user sees one entry
#     and one onboarding pass, but the DataflowSpec table ends up
#     with rows from BOTH templates.
#   - env_override: optional environment value the picker should
#     auto-set on the Environment form field when this entry is
#     selected. Used for templates that ship with a non-default env
#     suffix (DAIS uses ``_prod``).
#   - note: optional second paragraph displayed beneath the
#     description; surface non-trivial behaviour (like an env override)
#     here so first-time users understand why a field changed value
#     when they picked an entry.
#
# Order matches the recommended "complexity ladder" — start with
# Cars (1 table), then Multi-Source CDC (3 regional sources), then
# the two flagship demos.
