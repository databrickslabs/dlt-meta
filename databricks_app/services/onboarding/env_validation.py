"""Detect + validate the per-row ``env`` suffix in an onboarding spec.

The SDP-META onboarding parser requires per-row fields suffixed with
the active environment, e.g. ``bronze_database_demo`` when ``env=demo``.
If the form's Environment value doesn't match the suffix present on
these fields, the parser silently ``continue``s past every row (see
``onboard_dataflowspec.py:1139`` \u2014 added for multi-source CDC support)
and the dataflowspec tables come out empty WITH THE JOB STILL REPORTING
SUCCESS \u2014 the worst possible failure mode for a demo onboarding.

We detect the suffix(es) present in the template and pre-flight-reject
any Environment value that doesn't match.
