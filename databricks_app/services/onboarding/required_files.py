"""Required-files preflight for the onboarding preview UI.

Two pure helpers driven by ``/onboarding/preview``:

  * ``_extract_required_files`` \u2014 walks a parsed onboarding spec and
    returns every file path the spec references via a path-shape field
    (``source_path*``, ``source_schema_path``, ``*_data_quality_
    expectations_json_*``, ``silver_transformation_json_*``, plus same
    field names nested inside ``bronze_append_flows`` /
    ``silver_append_flows``), with ``{token}`` substitutions applied so
    paths match what the cluster will actually read.

  * ``_check_required_files_existence`` \u2014 for each extracted entry,
    decides whether the referenced file exists today (local FS, UC
    Volume, or unknown / can't classify).

Drives the "Required files" panel on the preview modal so users see
red-X / green-check status BEFORE clicking Run \u2014 the second-most-
common cause of "job SUCCESS, tables empty" is missing supporting
files (the first being env-suffix mismatch).

       AND the user provided a UC Volume ``local_supporting_dir``, the
       file SHOULD exist under ``local_supporting_dir`` (post-copy).

    2. If the path starts with ``uc_volume_path`` AND
       ``local_supporting_dir`` is a local path, strip the
       ``uc_volume_path`` prefix to get the relative-under-sdp_meta_conf,

       ``copy_to_uc_volume`` copies a directory into the volume rooted
       at ``basename(local_supporting_dir)``, so the local equivalent
       is ``parent(local_supporting_dir)/<rel>``.
