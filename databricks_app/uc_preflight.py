"""Unity Catalog pre-flight checks for the SDP-META Databricks App.

The App runs as a Databricks Apps service principal (its identity inside
the workspace is whatever `WorkspaceClient().current_user.me()` returns
when the platform's OAuth env vars are present). The demo launchers all
end up issuing ``CREATE SCHEMA`` against a user-supplied UC catalog. The
App SP is a fresh principal with zero default privileges, so unless the
catalog owner has granted it ``USE CATALOG`` + ``CREATE SCHEMA`` first,
every demo fails the same way:

    PermissionDenied: User does not have CREATE SCHEMA on Catalog '<cat>'

The SP can NEITHER grant itself those privileges (only the catalog owner
or a metastore admin can) NOR work around them. The right ergonomic is:

    1. Detect the gap up-front.
    2. Surface the EXACT GRANT SQL the catalog owner should run (in their
       own SQL editor session, not via the App).
    3. Block the demo until the gap is closed.

This module is the detection half of that flow; ``app.py`` wires it into
``/rundemo`` (pre-flight blocker) and ``/check-uc-grants`` (manual probe
for the "Test App access" button on the form).

Outside a Databricks Apps container the App SP doesn't exist, so callers
that exercise this module from a local CLI / unit test pass an explicit
``WorkspaceClient`` and identity. The default constructor relies on the
SDK's env-var credentials provider — same path the demos use.
