"""Launch the SDP-META interactive demo as a one-time job in a Databricks workspace.

Mirrors the pattern in ``integration_tests/run_integration_tests.py``:
authenticates against a workspace, uploads the demo notebook to a per-run
folder, submits a one-time **serverless** job with the demo notebook as a
single task, and blocks on completion.

Use this for:
  * CI smoke runs — pass ``--validate-counts true`` (the default) so the
    demo's final-validation cell asserts row counts and fails the job on
    any regression (broken append flow, broken sink, broken quarantine
    routing, etc.).
  * Headless demos — let an SA kick the demo against a fresh workspace
    without opening the notebook by hand.

The demo notebook handles everything else internally: UC schema/volume
creation, data generation/download, dataflowspec onboarding, and pipeline
creation (all 3 pipelines run on serverless). This launcher just wires up
the widgets and watches the run.

Three ways to install sdp-meta in the demo job
-----------------------------------------------

1. ``--install-source git_branch`` (default) -- the demo runs
   ``pip install git+https://github.com/databrickslabs/sdp-meta.git@<branch>``
   inside the job. Fastest path; matches the interactive demo experience.
2. ``--install-source whl_file --whl-file-path <UC volume path>`` -- you
   already uploaded a wheel; the demo just installs from it. Use this
   when the wheel is published by another job (e.g. release pipeline).
3. ``--build-and-upload-whl --uc-schema-name <s> --uc-volume-name <v>``
   -- the launcher builds the wheel from the local source tree, creates
   the UC schema/volume if needed, uploads the wheel, and points the
   demo at the resulting ``/Volumes/...`` path. Same machinery as
   ``databricks labs sdp-meta bundle prepare-wheel``.

Usage examples
--------------
::

    # Smoke run against a fresh per-run schema, default git branch.
    python demo/launch_interactive_demo.py \\
        --uc-catalog-name main \\
        --profile DEFAULT

    # Build the wheel locally, upload it to a UC volume, then run the
    # demo against it. One command, no manual `bundle prepare-wheel`.
    python demo/launch_interactive_demo.py \\
        --uc-catalog-name main \\
        --profile DEFAULT \\
        --build-and-upload-whl \\
        --uc-schema-name sdp_meta_demo \\
        --uc-volume-name sdp_meta_wheels

    # Validate a wheel that's ALREADY on a UC volume.
    python demo/launch_interactive_demo.py \\
        --uc-catalog-name main \\
        --profile DEFAULT \\
        --install-source whl_file \\
        --whl-file-path /Volumes/main/sdp_meta_demo/sdp_meta_wheels/\\

    # Deterministic data path (recommended for CI):
