**Q. What is DLT-META ?**

DLT-META is a solution/framework using Databricks Delta Live Tables aka DLT which helps you automate bronze and silver layer pipelines using CI/CD.

**Q. What are the benefits of using DLT-META ?**

- With DLT-META customers needs to only maintain metadata like onboarding.json, data quality rules and silver transformations and framework will take care of execution.
- In case of any input/output or data quality rules or silver transformation logic changes there will be only metadata changes using onboarding interface and no need to re-deploy pipelines.
- If you have 100s or 1000s of tables then DLT-META speeds up overall turn around time to production as customers needs to just produce metadata
