"""Git-ref-based wheel builder for backward-compatibility integration tests.

The backward-compatibility test runs Phase 1 against a v0.0.10 wheel and
Phase 2 against a v0.0.11 wheel built from the ``feature/sdp-meta`` branch.
Building both wheels from the SAME local clone — without polluting the
working tree — is what this module does.

Mechanism
---------

For each requested git ref:

1. Create a fresh ``git worktree`` under a sibling directory
   (``.bc_wheels/<ref-slug>/``). A worktree is a cheap second checkout
   of the same repo at the requested ref; the primary checkout the user
   is editing is left alone.
2. Run ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` inside the worktree to produce the
   ``.whl`` artifact in ``<worktree>/dist/``.
3. Copy the wheel out to ``.bc_wheels/dist/`` (a stable per-run location)
   so callers don't have to keep the worktree alive.
4. Remove the worktree (idempotent on subsequent calls — we ``--force``).

The builder is intentionally minimal: no virtualenv, no
``pip wheel . --no-deps``, no ``python -m build``. Just ``setup.py
bdist_wheel`` because that's what every released ref of this repo (and
the current ``feature/sdp-meta`` branch) supports out of the box without
extra dependencies. Build dependencies (``setuptools``, ``wheel``) are
expected on the developer's PATH already — the same ``pip install -e .``
they ran for unit tests covers it.

        Root of the git repo to build from. Defaults to the directory two
